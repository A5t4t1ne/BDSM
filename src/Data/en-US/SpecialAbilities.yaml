  name: "Analyst"
  rules: |
    The special ability *Analyst* lets you analyze artifacts, magical creatures, and spells. Heroes with this SA can make a check using *Magical Lore (appropriate application)* and collect more QL than usual (see *Magical Analysis* on **Core Rules** page **268**). Depending on the QL, you get a clearer picture of the object’s uses, the type of creature, or the spell’s magical effect. This SA gives you a new use of the skill *Magical Lore*.

    This special ability grants you a new use for the skill *Fast Talk*, which you can use to assist companions during combat.<br>

The hero must be able to see and hear the recipients, and the recipients must be able to hear the advice. Success grants the recipients a bonus of +1 AT, +1 Defense, and +1 RC for the next combat round (this bonus is not cumulative with other uses of *Leader*).

  name: "Tilt"
  rules: |
    A rider that wants to use a lance to attack an enemy must use the mount *command* Tilt (see *Rules for Mounted Combat*, **Core Rules** page **239**, for more details). Tilt must be used at a full gallop. Make a check using *Riding (Combat Maneuvers)*, and then make an attack with Lances (this does not require another action because it is considered part of the same maneuver). Horse and rider need not reduce their movement after the attack.<br>
    Tilt cannot be parried with a weapon, but can be dodged or parried with a shield. After a successful hit, or if the defender parries successfully, the rider usually releases the lance to avoid being knocked from the saddle by the impact. If the tilt is successful, increase the DP by 2 + (half of the mount’s MOV).<br>

    - Guild mages can choose one spell from an unfamiliar Tradition during Hero Creation. They can then cast this spell as if it were a spell from the mage’s own Tradition. Translating a spell in this manner takes a great deal of effort and can be achieved only at an academy.
    - Guild Mage spells can be written down in spell books and scrolls. Mages can then learn the spell from this written source without the assistance of a tutor.
    - Guild mages can create and use special guild mage Tradition artifacts (like mage’s staves).

  rules: |
    While using this ability, your magical talent remains completely hidden from undirected magical perception. Hiding from directed attempts to determine if you have magical abilities requires a successful *Willpower* check. Checks for liturgical chants or clairvoyance spells cast on a character for this purpose suffer a penalty equal to one-third of the character’s *Willpower* check SP (at least 1). You can neither cast spells nor sustain cast spells while cloaking your aura. You can combine *Hide Aura* with the advantage *Hidden Aura*. Using this special ability requires 1 action, and it can be temporarily halted by the spellcaster (this also requires one action). Turning off *Hide Aura* inflicts one level of the condition *Confusion* on the spellcaster. The effect ends when the spellcaster deactivates *Hide Aura*, falls asleep, or receives the condition *Unconscious*.

  name: "Binding of the Staff"
  effect: |
    The *Binding of the Staff* is the first staff enchantment cast on a mage's staff and serves to bind the staff to the mage. In addition, it renders the staff unbreakable, even though the wood retains its flexibility. Only elemental fire – burning hotter than a dragon's breath or an *Ignifaxius* spell – or a directed antimagic spell can destroy it. The staff is a magical weapon that cannot be enchanted with rituals like *Arcanovi* or other spells. A mage can possess only one staff at a time. Binding a staff has a one-time cost of 2 permanent AE. The mage can try to break the connection to a staff in order to bind a new one. After a mage's death, the staff loses all permanent AE and all of its magic after 24 hours.

  name: "Sword of Flame"
  effect: |
    This turns the staff into a hotly burning flame weapon, in the shape of either a long sword or, in some cultures, a scimitar. The *Sword of Flame* is a magical weapon and does extra damage to creatures susceptible to fire. It does 1D6+7 DP but otherwise uses all other stats for a long sword. The staff must be at least one yard long to become a *Sword of Flame*.<br>
    You can use the *Sword of Flame* in two ways, as follows.

    - You can wield it like a normal sword with the combat technique Swords. If you botch, the sword turns back into a mage’s staff. This use costs 1 AE per round.
    - You can make it fly and fight using telekinesis. You use the combat technique Swords and your attack stat for attacks. It moves with Movement 8. You must concentrate to control the sword. Making the *Sword of Flame* fly in a coordinated way is a *long action* (see **Core Rules**page **228**).

    If the sword ever moves more than 32 yards away from you, the effect ends and the sword reverts to a staff. This activation costs 2 AE per round.<br>
    To grab a flying *Sword of Flame*, make a successful attack with *Brawling* and the special ability Grapple (the sword has *Feat of Strength* 10 with 14 in all attributes, and PA equal to half of its AT).

    You can turn the staff into a 10-yard-long rope. When thrown, the rope coils itself around objects. As long as you touch the rope, you can tie and untie knots with a thought, taking 1 action each. You cannot use this effect to bind persons who aren’t suffering the state *immobilized*.

  rules: |
    This special ability allows witches to brew flying balm during the annual Witches’ Night, and then use objects that have been covered in the balm. Flying balm turns a wooden object as large as a table into a controllable flying instrument for a period of one year. Flying balm does not change the form, stability, or weight of the item, and the item can be controlled only by the witch who selected the object and applied the balm. Each witch receives only enough flying balm to treat one flying instrument, and the balm must be applied during the Witches’ Night gathering. Witches who lose their flying instruments must wait until the next Witches’ Night to replace them.

    The reaction is triggered when you spend 1 free action (if you do not spend the free action, the enemy does not react in this CR). The enemy reacts in one of the following ways. The result of the enemy's reaction depends on the net QL.

    *I'll get you for this!*: The enemy uses 1 free action to travel (MOV) feet towards the provocateur, if not otherwise engaged in combat. An enemy with no free actions remaining cannot use this reaction. The effect lasts for a number of CR equal to the net QL.

    *Taste my steel!*: The enemy reacts aggressively and attacks, receiving +1 AT and −2 DE. The effect lasts for a number of CR equal to the net QL.

    *Silence, knave!*: The enemy must spend 1 free action (to utter an insult, for example). The effect lasts for a number of CR equal to the net QL/2.

    To use this maneuver, the target must already have the state *Prone*. Make an AT with a penalty of −4. If successful, and the defense fails, the maneuver takes effect. You can no longer parry with the weapon being used, but you can still try to dodge. Your AT with that weapon succeeds automatically during subsequent CR. These attacks cause +1 DP, cumulative, in every CR after the first (i.e., no additional DP in the first CR, +1 DP in the second CR, +2 DP in the third CR, and so on). Roll DP as usual.<br>
    While Nail Down remains in effect, the target suffers the states *Prone* and *Bound* and cannot defend. You may free the target at the end of any CR. To escape, the target must win a competitive check on *Feat of Strength (Pushing & Bending)* against you. Each attempt costs 1 action.

    Placing an opponent in a headlock first requires grappling. In the next CR, make a Brawling AT. If successful, and the enemy fails to defend, the headlock takes effect. If the Brawling AT fails, the grappling ends.<br>
    An opponent in a headlock receives 1 DP every CR and must make a check on *Self-Control (Stay Conscious)* every CR. This check receives a penalty equal to the DP inflicted upon the target this CR. If the check fails, the target receives 1 level of *Stupor*.<br>
    An opponent in a headlock has two options, as follows:

    - Break out of the Headlock: the opponent makes a competitive check using *Feat of Strength (Dragging & Pulling)*. If successful, the headlock and the grapple end.
    - Attack: the target of the headlock tries to counterattack.

    You can release an opponent from *Pin Down* at the end of any CR; this requires no action. To break free, opponents must make a competitive check using *Feat of Strength (Pushing & Bending)* against the attacker. Each check requires 1 action.

The caster must be in a quiet location (such as in a remote part of the forest, or a quiet room), meditate for at least 5 minutes, and make a *Self-Control (Ignore Distractions)* check. This converts a maximum of QL x 3 LP to AE. At the end of the meditation period, the caster loses an additional 1D6 LP and will not recover any LP or AE for 24h during any regeneration phases, whether the Arcane Meditation succeeded or not.

First, the druid receives additional AE equal to his primary attribute. Also, the druid can use his LP to cast spells by converting remaining LP to AE at a ratio of 1 to 1, with no limit, and the druid can increase his AE above the normal maximum value. Finally, all spells cast during this time receive a bonus of 3, and the QL of all successful spells increases by 1 (maximum 6). After this time, the druid dies.

Spellcasting suffers a penalty of 1 per yard of distance from the ground, with a maximum penalty of 8. While over large bodies of water, the surface of the water counts as ground. Buildings, towers, and bridges also count as ground.
    - When witch spells fail, witches must pay one third the AE (not half the AE, as with mages).
    - When witches feel strong emotions befitting the spell, they receive a bonus of at most 2 points. When their feelings are artificially dampened (with ilmen leaf, for example), or when they cast spells in contradiction to their feelings, they suffer a penalty of no more than 2.
    - Witches can work themselves into a frenzy of emotion. It takes two combat rounds to gain a bonus of 1, up to a maximum of 2. This requires concentration (see **Core Rules** page **285**) and a free action.

    A valid target can trigger the spell accidentally by touching your hand, which means it can occur against your will. If no valid target presents itself within five CR, the spell expires without effect.<br>
    You cannot Charge Up more than one spell at a time.

  name: "Animal Shape"
  effect: |
    Your staff becomes an animal into which you can place your awareness. This enchantment has many transformation levels and paths that usually but not always begin with a small animal shape. Each transformation path, starting with the lowest, forms the requirement for the next higher level.<br>
    You must choose one of the following paths upon first learning this staff enchantment. The required staff volume and AP costs differ, depending on the animal's power.

    - Path of the Bird: Dove (6 volume, 15 AP) and Raven (7 volume, 20 AP)
    - Path of the Lizard: Chameleon (6 volume, 15 AP) and Spitting Cobra (7 volume, 20 AP)
    - Path of the Rodent: Squirrel (5 volume, 10 AP) and Beaver (6 volume, 15 AP)

    Transformation into the animal shape and back requires four actions, each. You retain your mental abilities while in the animal shape; your other stats are replaced by those of the animal.<br>
    While in the animal shape, you can use the animal's abilities - for instance, change colors while in the shape of a chameleon or spit venom while in the shape of a spitting cobra.<br>
    You cannot use any arcane spellworks or regenerate AE during regeneration phases while in animal form. Your body receives four levels of *Paralysis* during the transformation - as though under the influence of the spell Paralysis - and you count as *Petrified*.<br>
    You can only end this enchantment if you are in physical contact with your real body or if you run out of AE.<br>
    If something kills your animal shape, your mind returns to your body and you receive 4D6 DP (ignoring PRO). The same applies if you run out of AE or something unexpectedly severs your connection.

Also, it does not require the spell's incantation or gesture, and penalties for omitting them do not apply. To cast a stored spell, make a check against the staff's default attributes (14/14/14), with an SR equal to the stored spell's SP. *Adept's Spell Storage* cannot store rituals and the staff can store only one spell at a time.

  effect: |
    The *Binding of the Spell-Sword* is the first sword enchantment cast on a spell-sword and serves to bind the blade to the mage. Also, it renders the blade unbreakable, while maintaining its natural flexibility. Only elemental fire – burning hotter than a dragon's breath or an Ignifaxius spell – or a directed anti-magic spell can destroy it. The sword is a magical weapon that cannot be enchanted with rituals like *Arcanovi* or other spells. A mage can possess only one spellsword at a time.<br>
    Binding a sword has a one-time cost of 2/4/8 permanent AE, depending on its type. The mage can only ever be bound to one spellsword at a time. To bind a new sword, the mage will first have to break the connection to the currently bound sword.<br>
    After a mage's death, the spell-sword loses all permanent AE and all its magic after 24 hours.

    - Druids receive a bonus of 2 instead of 1 when they use the modification *Force* Spell.
    - Strong Iron Ban: Physical contact with smelted metals has a negative effect on a Druid's regeneration of AE and the casting of spells. Every two pounds of smelted metal the druid wears or is in contact with incurs a penalty of 1. If these circumstances persist for more than half an hour, regeneration of AE drops by 1 per 2 pounds of metal per regeneration phase. This rule replaces the usual rule of the *Iron Ban* for Spellcasters (see **Core Rules** page **255**).
    - Druids can create and use druidic traditional artifacts (such as the druid's dagger).

    The dagger is a magical weapon and cannot be enchanted in other ways, such as with the ritual *Arcanovi*. A druid can own only one druidic dagger.
    *Binding of the Dagger* has a onetime cost of 2 permanent AE.
    Druids may voluntarily release their connection to the dagger to, for example, bind a new dagger.<br>
    The dagger loses its permanent AE and all magic within 24 hours of the druid's death.

  effect: |
    The *Binding of the Magical Orb* is the first orb enchantment cast on an illusionist's magical orb and serves to bind the orb to the illusionist. Also, it renders the orb unbreakable. Only elemental fire – burning hotter than a dragon's breath or an Ignifaxius spell – or a directed anti-magic spell can destroy it.<br>
    The orb is a magical weapon that cannot be enchanted with rituals like *Arcanovi* or other spells. An illusionist can possess only one orb at a time. Binding an orb has a one-time cost of 2 permanent AE. The illusionist can try to break the connection to an orb to bind a new one.<br>
    After an illusionist's death, the orb loses all permanent AE and all its magic after 24 hours.

Divine Protection requires 1 action to activate and it lasts for 5 minutes. When the duration ends, suffer 1 level of *Stupor*.

  rules: |
    Companions of Good Gold receive an additional application for the skill *Warfare*. When they wish to position their companions for an attack advantage, they must spend 1 action and make a *Warfare* check. Up to QL/2 other people within visual and hearing range automatically have an advantageous position for the next CR, which provides a bonus of +2 to AT and defense (see **Core Rules** page **238**). This advantage is in effect until the end of the next CR. The GM has the final say as to how many opportunities for a good position exist, meaning fewer or no heroes may benefit from this special ability. This bonus is not cumulative with other uses of Companions of Good Gold or other special abilities that improve RC, AT, or defense. No hero may use two advantageous positions at one time.

    - Arcane bards can learn cantrips, but no other arcane spellworks
    - To successfully cast a magical melody from Tradition (Arcane Bard), the target must hear the music and be within range of its effects. Creatures with no sense of hearing are immune. Simply covering one's ears is no defense. However, the GM decides if the target gains immunity (or receives a bonus to resist) by using more effective aids to prevent hearing – such as plugging ears with wax.
    - Arcane bards can create and use special Tradition artifacts (magical instruments)
    - Arcane bards cannot learn other magical traditions, and no character with another magical tradition may learn Tradition (Arcane Bard).
    - Arcane bards can invest no more than 25 AP on magical advantages (excluding the advantage Spellcaster) and can gain no more than 25 AP (instead of the usual 50 AP) from magical disadvantages (see **Core Rules** page **162**).
    - Arcane bards may not choose advantages or disadvantages having to do with spells and rituals; they may choose only those that influence their magical melodies.
    - This Tradition's primary attribute is Charisma; however, arcane bards use only half of this stat (rounded up) to calculate their base AE pool or purchase AE.

Blind creatures are immune; however, targets with bad eyesight are not immune, as the magic still affects them. The GM decides whether extenuating circumstances - such as closing one's eyes or wearing a blindfold - confers any immunity to the effects or perhaps grants a bonus to resist the magical dance.
    Arcane dancers can create and use special *Tradition artifacts (magical attire)*
    - Arcane dancers cannot learn other magical traditions, and no character with another magical tradition may learn *Tradition (Arcane Dancer)*
