# BDSM

Of course it stands for: **_Browser DSA Stat Manager_** and nothing else you horny guys.
The goal is to create a Cross-Platform application for keeping track of your hero stats in the Pen & Paper game "Das schwarze Auge" (DSA).

Everything is made up from scratch except the hero/optolith decoder logic. That part is copied and translated to python from the C# project [Ducttapemummy/DELM](https://github.com/Ducttapemummy/DELM).


## Improvement
Feedback or suggestions are highly appreciated, either for missing/wrong background stuff or to compensate my lack of front-end development skills.


## Note
I have never worked with databases before so don't be too mad if I screwed up something badly but instead leave an issue on this repository, thank you.
