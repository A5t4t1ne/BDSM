  name: "Analyze Arcane Structure"
  effect: |
    This spell reveals whether an object or creature is magical, and if so, it also reveals details about the object or creature’s arcane structure. This information can be useful for a magical analysis. When performing a magical analysis, the maximum number of QL you can normally achieve with the *Magical Lore (appropriate application)* check is equal to the QL of the *Analyze* spell. For example, a spellcaster who gets a result of 3 QL with *Analyze* can usually achieve no more than 3 QL in the *Magical Lore* check (exception—see the special ability Analyst on **Core Rules** page **214**). Similarly, with a QL of 4 in *Analyze*, the spellcaster can normally achieve at most a QL of 4 in the *Magical Lore* check for the analysis, and so on.

    For more about conducting magical analyses, see **Core Rules** page **268**.

    If you start casting the spell during the time period defined by a mortally wounded character’s Constitution, you can save that character’s life (see *Life-Saving Measures and Death* in Chapter 12: Detailed Rules, on **Core Rules** page **340**).

  effect: |
    This friendship spell, which was developed by the elves, creates feelings of sympathy and friendship toward the caster. The exact effects depend on the target’s feelings for the caster beforehand, but basically the connection between target and caster improves by one level per QL (minimum of one level). If the target and caster don’t already know each other, the starting level is usually somewhere between 4 (Dislike) and 6 (Sympathy), though advantages like *Good Looks* and disadvantages like *Prejudice* can also affect this first impression.

    - **Level 1:** The target hates the spellcaster.
    - **Level 2:** The target is the spellcaster’s enemy.
    - **Level 3:** The target despises the spellcaster.
    - **Level 4:** The target has some mild dislike for the spellcaster.
    - **Level 5:** The target feels neutral about the spellcaster.
    - **Level 6:** The target feels some sympathy towards the spellcaster.
    - **Level 7:** The target feels trust and friendship for the spellcaster.
    - **Level 8:** The target feels strong loyalty towards the spellcaster.
    - **Level 9:** The target is smitten with the spellcaster (but won’t die for the relationship).

    *Bannbaladin* has no effect on the target’s memory. When the spells ends, the target remembers feelings and actions. The target might even notice the spell while it’s in use, but this has no effect on the target’s new attitude. Your actions can affect the target’s attitude towards you.

    This basic anti-magic spell impairs all kinds of magic in a radius of QL x 2 yards around the spellcaster. It does so by issuing vibrations that disrupt surrounding arcane patterns, imposing a penalty (based on QL—see below) on all checks for spells and rituals either cast in the area or taking effect there. *Disruptivo* affects your own spells, as well. Before casting, you must declare whether the zone will move with you or remain stationary.

    - **QL 1:** Penalty -1

  effect: |
    The spellcaster creates one or more illusory duplicates of the target that move synchronously with that individual, appearing to blend into the target and split off again.<br>
    The number of duplicates depends on QL. You can create fewer duplicates than allowed, if desired.

    - **QL 1:** 1 duplicate, for 2 combat rounds
    - **QL 2:** 1 duplicate
    - **QL 3:** 2 duplicates
    - **QL 4:** 3 duplicates
    - **QL 5:** 4 duplicates
    - **QL 6:** 4 duplicates for twice the normal duration

    It is not easy to determine which image is the original target creature, and close combat attacks, ranged attacks, and spells stand a good chance of hitting a duplicate instead. If an attack does hit the target, it can be parried or dodged. Duplicatus does not block area effect attacks. You can read more about illusion spells and spotting illusions on **Core Rules** Page **258**.

The light’s brightness depends on QL. You can reduce the brightness, but only by one level. The light’s radius varies depending on its brightness.

    - **QL 1:** The light is as bright as a candle.
    - **QL 2:** The light is as bright as a torch.
    - **QL 3:** The light is as bright as a campfire.
    - **QL 4:** The light is bright enough to illuminate a 15'x15' room.

  effect: |
    This spell creates an invisible dome around you that can absorb magical attacks originating from without. The spell actually creates a sphere, but since spellcasters are usually standing on the ground when using this spell, it functions more like a dome. This dome has a radius of 3 yards and a strength of AE + QL x 3. *Gardianum* absorbs points of spell damage equal to the dome’s strength, on a point for point basis, until the dome’s strength is reduced to zero (at which time it collapses). The dome does not ward off magical beings or magical weapons. Unabsorbed damage is dealt to the spellcaster in the normal way. The dome moves with the spellcaster, and protects everybody within its radius.

It can also increase the effectiveness of an *Analyze spell* or a magical analysis (see **Core Rules** pages **268** and **287**). Depending on the AE of the target, the check can suffer a penalty or receive a bonus.<br>
    The spellcaster can examine only one creature or object within range, not everything that happens to be in view. The spellcaster receives information or bonuses based on QL.

    - **QL 1:** Is there magic present?
    - **QL 2:** The maximum QL you can achieve with the magical analysis check rises by 1.
    - **QL 3:** Receive a bonus of 1 on the check for the *Analyze spell* cast subsequently on the same target.
    - **QL 4:** Receive a bonus of 2 on the check for the *Analyze spell* cast subsequently on the same target.
    - **QL 5:** The maximum QL you can achieve with the magical analysis check rises by 2.
    - **QL 6:** Receive a bonus of 3 on the check for the *Analyze spell* cast subsequently on the same target.

    Bonuses to maximum QL or *Analyze* are not cumulative. Also, the hero receives only the highest bonus of each type. For example, a result of QL 4 for *Odem* grants an *Analyze* bonus of 2 (not 3) and the maximum QL for magical analysis rises by 1. Similarly, a result of QL 6 for *Odem* grants an *Analyze* bonus of 3 (not 6), and the maximum QL for the magical analysis rises by 2 (not 3).

  effect: |
    The target’s body stiffens and hardens. If the paralysis is complete (Level IV), the body transforms into a nearly indestructible substance without changing weight. A body transformed this way cannot be injured by non-magical weapons, fire, or falls. Those affected cannot move, feel, or hear anything, but can see within their field of vision. This spell delays the effects of poisons and diseases, granting more time to obtain treatment.

    - **QL 1:** 1 level of *Paralysis*, for 2 combat rounds

  effect: |
    The target broom or other staff attacks a target of your choice at a distance of up to 8 yards (after casting the spell, both target and broom can move farther away from the witch). The broom is *unbreakable* for the duration of the spell and is considered a magical weapon that makes 1 attack per combat round. It cannot use combat maneuvers. Its stats are INI 12+1D6, AT 8 (+QL x 3), DP 1D6+3, MOV 12. If the broom kills its target before the duration expires, or the enemy somehow flees, it attacks another target at random within 16 yards (this might even be the caster). If no target is within range at that time, the spell ends.<br>
    To grab the broom, you must make a successful attack with *Brawling* and the special ability Grapple (the broom/staff has PA equal to half its AT, *Feat of Strength* 10, and 14 in all relevant attributes).

  effect: |
    This spell turns one living thing into another, but the new form must be smaller and lighter. The target cannot be transformed into a magical or supernatural creature. If the change is extreme (a mammoth turned into a mouse, for example), the check suffers a penalty of up to 3. The spell can turn the target only into a creature known to the spellcaster.<br>
    The target’s mental capacities and memories remain more or less intact, but the target must use the physical abilities of the new shape. Life points and natural PRO stay the same—in other words, you cannot turn a hulking orc chieftain into a dandelion and then easily uproot him. Also, *Salander* does not transform equipment. When the spell duration ends, the target retains only dim memories of the time spent as an animal or plant. For more details about transformations, see *Rules for Transformations*, on **Core Rules** page **258**.

The spell improves hair and skin, whitens the teeth, and changes your features to fit an ideal of beauty or physical perfection. Checks using *Seduction (Flirting, Romantic Arts)* and *Fast-Talk (Flattering)* receive a bonus equal to the QL. Other social skills can get the bonus, too, depending on the situation. The transformation has no effect on creatures with standards of beauty that differ from those of the spellcaster.

The closer you wear this equipment to the body, the greater the chance that it travels with you (clothing stands the best chance). Anything you wish to bring along either travels with you in one piece or stays behind—it is not torn or damaged. The GM has the final say. You must have visited the target location prior to attempting the trip, or at least be able to see it currently (if you have not visited the location previously but can see it when you cast the spell, the check suffers a penalty of 2). In either event, the target location can be no further than QL x 3 miles from the caster.

    Your shadow comes to life and fights as an ally. It can move up to 13 yards away from you. This spell summons only one shadow, and you must wait for the spell's duration to end before summoning another. For the shadow's stats, see the Shadow sidebar on **Magic of Aventuria** Page **129**.<br>
    The shadow's stats receive non-cumulative bonuses based on the spell's QL.

    - **QL 1**: No bonus
    - **QL 2**: +1 AT, +5 LP, +1 SPI
    - **QL 3**: +1 AT, +1 PA, +1 DO, +1 DP, +5 LP, +1 SPI, Feint I
    - **QL 4**: +2 AT, +1 PA, +1 DO, +1 DP, +1 PRO, +10 LP, +1 SPI, Feint I
    - **QL 5**: +2 AT, +2 PA, +2 DO, +1 DP, +1 PRO, +10 LP, +2 SPI, Feint I
    - **QL 6**+: +3 AT, +2 PA, +2 DO, +2 DP, +1 PRO, +15 LP, +2 SPI, Feint I+II

    Spells must have the property Anti-Magic to affect the shadow. Conditions do not affect shadows.

    If the shadow's LP drop to 0, you lose all remaining AE immediately (and you lose 2 AE permanently). The shadow takes 7 weeks to grow back, during which time you have no shadow and therefore cannot cast this spell.People tend to stigmatize those with no shadow (mainly in lands where they worship the Twelvegods) and view them as possible demon worshipers or Blessed Ones of the Nameless God.

They must also belong to the category Domesticated Animal or Wild Animal (not a monster). This spell affects freshwater and saltwater animals equally, and can only be used to enchant a single creature.<br>

  effect: |
    This spell lifts and moves a wooden item through the air. The target can be made of several materials besides wood as long as its total weight is no more than QL x 40 pounds. It moves at a maximum speed of QL +2 yards per action. The spellcaster must spend 1 AE per 10 pounds of weight.<br>
    Items piled onto the target add their weight for purposes of calculating total weight. The target moves sluggishly and cannot be used to attack or parry.<br>
    Anyone attempting to stop a moving item, such as by grabbing it or pulling on it, must make a *Feat of Strength (Dragging and Pulling)* check with a penalty equal to the spell's QL.

  name: "Witch Knot"
  effect: |
    *Witch's Knot* creates an imaginary barrier for all intelligent creatures that come within 48 feet of the barrier. Each target perceives the barrier differently (for example, as a chasm or a wall of fire). Targets that realize the barrier is a spell cannot simply overcome the obstacle.
    The caster chooses a focus point within the range of the spell. The barrier must touch this point and runs in a straight line for QL x 6 feet. The caster also decides which part of the barrier touches the focus point.<br>
    Anyone trying to get past the Witch's Knot barrier must make a *Willpower (Resist Threats)* check with a penalty of 2 + QL. If successful, the barrier stops affecting them for the duration of the spell. If the check fails, the Witch's Knot remains the Witch's Knot remains an impassable obstacle.<br>
    Attempts to overcome the barrier require one action. Heroes may make more than one attempt to succeed.

  name: "Agony"
  effect: |
    The target suffers pain that usually manifests as severe muscle cramps. Evil mages can substitute Agony for the skill *Intimidation (Torture)*. The target must make a competitive *Self-Control (Resist Torture)* check against Agony, with an additional penalty equal to the pain level of the spell(in addition to any other modifications). After casting the spell, you must touch the target within QL combat rounds for it to take effect, otherwise the spell simply dissipates. If the target actively avoids your touch, you need a successful, undefended Brawling attack +2 or an AT +2 with your Tradition artifact to touch them.

    - **QL 1**: no additional effect

  name: "Ignisphaero"
  effect: |
    A ball of fire moves in a straight line from your hands toward the target. You need not spend an additional action to hit the target after casting this spell; the casting time includes the hit. The fireball explodes upon striking the target or another firm obstacle (such as a wall or a shield). If the fireball exceeds the range without hitting a target, it simply dissipates. *Ignisphaero* has a 5 yard blast radius and may hit your allies. The spell inflicts 2D6 + (QL x 3) DP within 1 yard around the impact. Inanimate objects take structure damage from this spell when hit. Reduce the damage by 3 DP for each additional yard of distance from the point of impact.<br>
    The fireball hits automatically if a target does not take active steps to avoid it. To attempt to avoid it, the target must use a defense and make a *Body Control (Combat Maneuvers)* check. If successful, the target manages to move 1 yard away from the center of the explosion per QL. The target's PRO applies, as usual.<br>
    Flammable targets catch fire when you roll a 1-3 on 1D6. If clothing starts to burn, the wearer gains the status *Burning* on a Small Surface (see **Core Rules** Page **341**).

  effect: |
    The witch summons up to QL x 2 serpents, which then enter the fight. The maximum number of serpents that appear is equal to the number of opponents the witch is facing. The serpents appear within a radius of QL/2 yards of a spot on the ground (within the spell's range) chosen by the caster. Afterwards, the serpents are free to move as far from the place of summoning as needed to fight.<br>
    The caster chooses opponents for the serpents to attack, but cannot assign more than one serpent per opponent. A summoned serpent disappears the moment its opponent dies. Summoned serpents are made of pure magic and thus count as magical creatures. When the duration ends, the serpents simply disappear.<br>
    They use the stats of the staff serpent (see **Core Rules** Page **330**), but have no venom.

Targets may notice that something is peering into their mind by making a Perception check with a penalty equal to the spell's QL, though they cannot tell who is responsible for the intrusion.<br>
    Targets can use Willpower checks, also subject to the QL penalty, to suppress (and thus shield) their emotions. A very emotional target may suffer an additional penalty of up to -3 points, at the GM's discretion.

  effect: |
    An opponent remains paralyzed a long as the caster stares at the target. The target suffers effects based on the spell's QL. Effects from multiple spells are not cumulative; use only the highest QL obtained.

    - **QL 1**: State of *Bound*
    - **QL 2**: 1 level of *Paralysis*, state of *Bound*
    - **QL 3**: 2 levels of *Paralysis*, state of *Bound*

    - **QL 5**: 4 levels of *Paralysis*, state of *Bound*
    - **QL 6**: 4 levels of *Paralysis*, state of *Incapacitated*

    For this spell to work, the witch must be able to stare into the target's eyes, during which time, all the witch's other checks suffer a penalty of 2.<br>
    The spell ends when the target suffers damage or moves (or is moved) from its spot, the caster looks away or moves out of spell range, or if the caster shuts both eyes. If visual contact is interrupted (somebody runs past, the lights go out, or somebody covers the caster's eyes), the caster must make a *Self-Control (Ignore Disturbances)* check to sustain the spell.<br>
    If visual contact is interrupted for more than 2 CR, the spell ends automatically. The target may not break eye contact.<br>
    As long as the spell persists, the target may not make close combat attacks or ranged attacks, or attempt defenses.

    This spell creates a transparent but slightly shimmering (and thus, visible) wall that physical objects cannot penetrate. The wall stops things like arrows, bolts, *Ignifaxius* spells, and Living Creatures. It does not protect against heat, cold, light, gasses, incorporeal beings, or spells and liturgical chants that do not have a physical component. Select a point within range of the spell. The barrier covers a straight line with a length of QL x 2 yards through that point. You decide the orientation in which the line crosses that point. The barrier is 3 yards tall, has no thickness, and can only stand upright (it cannot lie on the ground or slant at an angle). The barrier has 100 structure points. If this total drops to 0 or less, the wall dissipates.

  name: "Ablativum"
  effect: |
    The spell creates an invisible dome around you that moves with you and protects everything inside from spells. The so-called dome is a sphere; however, since you usually stand on the ground, its spherical nature is rarely relevant.<br>
    The dome has a radius of three yards and a shield strength of QL x 3. If friendly or enemy arcane spellworks target something within the dome, reduce that spellwork's QL by the shield's strength. If this reduces the QL to 0, the effect is completely blocked. The shield's strength lowers with this process (-1 shield strength per QL it stops) and the Ablativum ends early if its QL falls below 1<br>
    If an arcane spellwork with an area of effect - such as Ignisphaero - touches the Ablativum shield, the shield's strength lowers by an amount equal to that spell's QL.<br>
    If an arcane spellwork persists over multiple CR in the area of the Ablativum, lower the shield's strength by that spellwork's QL every CR. If an arcane spellwork with a higher QL than the Ablativum's shield strength penetrates the shield, it comes into effect with its remaining QL reduced by the shield's strength, while the shield's strength is reduced to 0 and the Ablativum ends.

  effect: |
    A ray of ore shoots out from your fingers, hitting your target in a straight line of sight. You do not need to use an additional action to hit the target after casting this spell; the casting time includes the time the ray takes to hit the target.<br>
    The target receives 2D6 (QL x 2) DP when hit. The ray of ore is a ranged attack with a ranged weapon and the target can block it or dodge, accordingly. It inflicts structural damage to shields it hits. The ray hits automatically if the target does not defend against it. If the ray of ore hits the target, the target's PRO reduces the DP, as usual. Furthermore, if you roll a 1-3 on 1D6, the target receives one level of *Encumbrance*, which lasts five minutes.

  effect: |
    A ball of ore shoots from your hand in a straight line, hitting your target. You need not spend an additional action to hit the target after casting this spell; the casting time includes the hit. The ball of ore explodes upon striking the target or another firm obstacle (such as a wall or a shield). If the ball of ore exceeds the range without hitting a target, it simply dissipates. Archosphaero has a 5 yard blast radius and may hit your allies.<br>
    The spell inflicts 2D6 (QL x 3) DP to both animate and inanimate objects within 1 yard of the point of impact. Reduce the damage by 3 DP for each additional yard of distance from the point of impact.<br>
    The ball of ore hits automatically if a target does not take active steps to avoid it. To attempt to avoid it, the target must use a defense and make a *Body Control (Combat Maneuvers)* check. If successful, the target manages to move 1 yard away from the center of the explosion per QL.<br>
    The target's PRO applies, as usual. If you roll a 1-3 on 1D6, the target gains 1 level of *Encumbrance* for five minutes. The explosion can affect all targets within the blast radius.

    Every CR, creatures inside the vortex must succeed at a *Feat of Strength (Pulling & Dragging)* check, otherwise they are pulled 2 yards closer to the center. If they try to hold onto a fixed object, they receive a bonus of +1 to their *Feat of Strength* check.<br>
    Creatures within the radius of the vortex cannot move away from it in a normal manner.<br>
    When the vortex opens, a target in the center of the zone can make a *Perception (Spot)* check with a penalty of -3. If they succeed, they intuitively move 2 yards away from the center.

    The spell creates an invisible dome with 3 yards radius that surrounds and moves with you and protects everything inside from spells. The so-called dome is actually a sphere; however, since you usually stand on the ground, the spherical nature is rarely relevant.<br>
    Demons can enter it, but the dome's magic absorbs their attacks (and any DP they inflict) within the radius. Demons become half-immaterial and their attacks simply pass through their enemies or the dome completely absorbs them, like water by a sponge. For this purpose, the dome has a shield strength of AE + (QL x 3) that can absorb an equal number of DP.<br>
    If the shield strength falls below 1, the dome collapses and the spell expires.

    If you achieve more QL than the summoning difficulty (summoning difficulties of 0 or higher count as 0), you can exorcise a lesser ghost. This can be a summoned or a free ghost creature. You can also banish ghosts bound to or possessing objects or creatures.<br>
    When you exorcise the ghost, the heptagram draws it in and returns it to the realm of the dead. Afterward, it cannot reappear in the Third Sphere on its own, but someone can summon it again

Such checks count as an action. Another person can make the *Treat Wounds* check for the target.

    If the target explicitly observes something like a door or an object, they notice all changes but cannot tell what causes the changes. For example, the target notices a door opening or closing but cannot tell who caused it to move.

    The target follows a single command from you that does not overtly contradict their self-preservation instinct. This means they may commit a theft, answer a single question, or aid you in battle, but they cannot, for instance, jump off a cliff or eat their own hands.<br>
    You cannot use this spell to make the target follow different commands throughout the spell's duration (for example, “*I command you to obey all my orders.*”) or truthfully answer several questions. Also, you cannot issue long chains of commands (such as, “*Open the door, walk inside, light a candle, and smash the crate*”); you can issue only single, brief orders.<br>
    The GM has the final say as to whether an order is valid.

  effect: |
    If you become the target of an attack spell, you can bounce it back at your enemy using Brawling or your Tradition artifact to Parry with a penalty of -4. If you succeed, the spell ricochets back at the user and reaches its target at the start of the next CR. A combat spell is any spell causing DP or sDP for which the caster rolls at least one die.<br>
    You cannot deflect spells with an area of effect. If the new target has a different SPI or TOU from the original target, use the ones from the original target regardless. The spell's original range also does not play a role when throwing back the spell.<br>
    Every time you deflect a spell with Invercano, decrease its QL by 1. If the QL falls to 0, the spell dissipates.

    After casting the spell, you have QL CR to touch the target and trigger the spell's effect, otherwise the spell fizzles. If the target actively avoids your touch, you need a successful, undefended Brawling attack 2 or an AT 2 with your Tradition artifact to touch them.

    This spell fixes the target object to the ground.

    The surface on which you place the item can be level ground or a similar, even surface, such as on a table or a ship's deck. The surface you choose remains movable, so attaching something to sand, loose earth, or a small piece of furniture is pointless.<br>
    If someone destroys the object while the spell is in effect, debris or the object's contents remain stuck to the surface. When this happens, lifting any one piece - and therefore ending the spell - requires an *Feat of Strength check*.

    A storm ball shoots from your hand in a straight line, hitting your target. You need not spend an additional action to hit the target after casting this spell; the casting time includes the hit. The storm ball explodes upon striking the target or another firm obstacle (such as a wall or a shield). If the storm ball exceeds the range without hitting a target, it simply dissipates.<br>
    Orcanosphaero has a 5 yard blast radius and may hit your allies. The spell inflicts 2D6 + (QL x 3) DP within 1 yard around the impact. Inanimate objects take structure damage from this spell when hit. Reduce the damage by 3 DP for each additional yard of distance from the point of impact.<br>
    The storm ball hits automatically if a target does not take active steps to avoid it. To attempt to avoid it, the target must use a defense and make a *Body Control (Combat Maneuvers)* check. If successful, the target manages to move 1 yard away from the center of the explosion per QL. The target's PRO applies, as usual. If you roll a 1-3 on 1D6, the target gains the state *Prone*.

    You raise the physical remains of a deceased creature for a short time as an undead. You can raise simple mummies, skeletons, and zombies with this spell; however, your targets may not be larger than size category medium.<br>
    Raising the undead uses the same mechanics as summoning. The undead creature carries out QL + 1 orders and you can use improvements with it just like demons and elementals (see **Core Rules** Page **263**).

You must make an *Animal Lore* check to understand the animal's conceptual world. Depending on this check's QL, the GM may give a more detailed description to ensure you interpret the animal's thoughts correctly.

    Change the temperature of an object no larger than a simple clothes chest by /- 100 degrees Celsius (+/- 180 degrees Fahrenheit) from its starting temperature. The caster must state the desired change and cannot change it once set. Also, the temperature change works in one direction only (for example, an object cannot be cooled and then warmed using the same casting).<br>
    Anyone touching objects that are extremely hot (or extremely cold; just use the same rules) use the rules for *Burning* (see **Core Rules** Page **341**). When the ritual ends, the object returns to its original temperature.<br>
    Large temperature changes cause 1D6 structure points of damage to most objects. The GM has the final word.

    The ritual creates a cylindrical zone where Dere's gravity does not apply. The spellcaster chooses a spot within the spell's range. Gravity releases everything within a cylinder of radius QL x 15 feet from that spot, by QL x 15 feet tall.<br>
    The unusual environments cause a penalty of 1 to all checks within the zone. To move while weightless, make a *Swimming (Diving)* check. If successful, you move 3 feet per QL. Accidents, botches, and other effects (GM discretion) cause a person to drift out of the zone and fall back to the ground.<br>
    Creatures in the zone when the effect ends suffer falling damage (see **Core Rules** Page **340**) as they, too, fall back to the ground. The GM decides they distance they fall

    The GM has the final say as to which items connect to each other (for example, a lock might be part of a door, but a door is not a part of a wall).<br>
    This ritual does not replace craft skills - you cannot use it to fashion metal into a sharp, durable sword blade. When the ritual's duration ends, the item immediately becomes solid again.
