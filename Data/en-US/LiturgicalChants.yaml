  effect: |
    This liturgical chant creates a sphere of darkness around the Blessed One with a diameter of QL x 3 yards. Anyone inside the sphere suffers a visibility penalty equal to the QL (see *Visibility* on **Core Rules** page **348**). Natural and magical light sources cannot penetrate the sphere or provide illumination within. However, if another Blessed One uses a chant to create light within, the higher QL determines whether the sphere contains light or darkness (like a competitive check). This effect is all or nothing—the sphere is not lit by a dim, mixed light. You do not suffer any penalties from the darkness you create. Before casting, you must declare whether the sphere will move (with you at its center) or remain stationary if you walk away.

    Opponents must make checks with *Willpower (Face Threats)* to attack you (and must get a QL higher than the liturgical chant’s QL to do so). If they fail their check, they cannot attack. If they succeed, their attack suffers a penalty equal to the QL of the liturgical chant. This liturgical chant only protects the caster. As long as the liturgical chant remains in effect, the Blessed One cannot make attacks (close or ranged combat) or initiate other offensive actions against opponents, but can support companions.

  effect: |
    The AE of the target can give a bonus or penalty for the check. The Blessed One can examine only one creature or object within range, not everything that happens to be in view. The Blessed One gains knowledge or bonuses based on QL (provided the Blessed One understands the magic being studied).

    - **QL 1:** Is there magic present?
    - **QL 2:** The maximum QL for the magical analysis check increases by 1.
    - **QL 3:** Receive a bonus of 1 on the check for the ritual *Analys* (or similar liturgical chant) cast subsequently on the same target.
    - **QL 4:** Receive a bonus of 2 on the check for the ritual *Analys* (or similar liturgical chant) cast subsequently on the same target.
    - **QL 5:** The maximum QL for the magical analysis check increases by 2.
    - **QL 6:** Receive a bonus of 3 on the check for the ritual *Analys* (or similar liturgical chant) cast subsequently on the same target.

    Bonuses to maximum QL or *Analys* (or similar liturgical chant) are not cumulative. Also, the hero receives only the highest bonus of each type. For example, a result of QL 4 for *See Magic* grants an *Analys* (or similar liturgical chant) bonus of 2 (not 3) and the maximum QL for magical analysis increases by 1. Similarly, a result of QL 6 for *See Magic* grants an *Analys* (or similar liturgical chant) bonus of 3 (not 6), and the maximum QL for the magical analysis increases by 2 (not 3).

It makes blessed crops more resistant to disease and vermin, and hampers the growth of unwanted plants. *Field Blessing* does not protect plants from external influences like droughts, floods, or hailstorms.

    If the sanctified object is a weapon, treat it as a sacred weapon. Normally the object cannot weigh more than 8 pounds, but the object can be an additional 2 pounds heavier per QL. *Sanctify Object* is mainly used to create Raven’s beaks (for Blessed Ones of Boron), sun-scepters (for Blessed Ones of Praios), and Rondra’s Crests (for Blessed Ones of Rondra).

    The chant creates a dome with a 3-yard radius around your character, accompanied by a slight shimmer, light effects, or other divine signs. The dome is actually a sphere; however, since your character usually stands on the ground, the spherical nature is rarely relevant. Demons can enter it, but the dome’s magic absorbs all their attacks (and the DP) within the radius. Demons become half-immaterial, and their attacks simply pass through their enemies, or the dome completely absorbs them, like water by a sponge. The dome has a shield strength of invested KP + (QL x 3) that can absorb an equal number of DP. If the shield strength falls below 1, the dome collapses, and the liturgical chant ends.

    The negative traits of up to QL/2 base units of an intoxicant do not apply. Until the duration ends, intoxicants you consume still influence your character’s mental state, but do not feed addiction and do not cause headaches, damage, or conditions. Even after the duration has expired, none of these effects will occur as long as consumption has already taken place. Intoxicants consumed after the duration ends affect your character normally.

  effect: |
    The target follows a single command from your character that does not overtly go against their self-preservation instinct or the principles of your character’s deity. This means they may commit a theft, answer a single question, or aid your character in battle, but they cannot, for instance, jump off a cliff or eat their own hands. The target cannot do anything that is not explicitly part of the command or necessary to carry out the command. Targets do not follow commands literally; they follow the intent of the command. It is not possible for the target to ignore the command due to badly chosen requirements.

    The chant creates a dome with a 3-yard radius around your character, accompanied by a slight shimmer, light effects, or other divine signs. The dome is actually a sphere; however, since your character usually stands on the ground, the spherical nature is rarely relevant.<br>
    The dome has a shield strength of invested KP + (QL x 3). It moves with your character and protects everyone inside. It absorbs its shield strength in DP caused by offensive liturgical chants (chants that do DP or sDP). If the shield strength ever falls below 1, the dome collapses, the liturgical chant ends, and the original target takes any damage the shield did not absorb.

    Whether or not a target defends against your character’s successful attack, you may write down the average DP + any bonuses you receive from the damage threshold and SA (to calculate average DP: 1D6 is a 4, and you add the weapon bonus; a sword of 1D6+4 DP does 4 + 4 = 8 average DP). The attack does not cause damage at this moment. Rather you add the average DP to the next successful attack within the duration. You cannot stack more than two attacks in this manner.<br>
    After the stacked attacks, you must make one final attack, within the duration of the chant, where you add the stacked DP. The effect ends if the final attack using the stacked DP fails or the target succeeds at defense against it. You may try again from the start while the chant’s duration continues.

    A jet of black or purple flames shoots out from your character’s fingers, hitting the target in a straight line. You do not need to use an additional action to hit the target after casting this liturgical chant; the liturgical time includes the hit. The target receives 2D6 + (QL x 2) DP when hit. The jet of flames is a ranged attack with a ranged weapon, and the target can block it or dodge, accordingly. It inflicts structural damage to shields if it hits them. The jet hits automatically if the target does not defend against it. If the jet of flames hits the target, the target’s PRO reduces the DP, as usual. Furthermore, if you roll a 1-3 on 1D6, the target also receives 1 level of *Fear*.

  name: "Rat Swarm"
  effect: |
    The Blessed One immediately turns into a swarm of rats (for stats, see **Gods of Aventuria** page **116**). The number of rats in the swarm is equal to their maximum number of LP. The Blessed One controls all the rats for the duration, and they must come together at the end of the duration to transform back. The body of the Blessed One can re-form if enough animals are alive and touching—the chant’s QL determines the minimum number of rats required: QL 1-2, 50%; QL 3-4, 25%; QL 5-6: 10%. Rats that are not with the swarm at the end of the duration simply die. The Blessed One’s body retains any damage the rats suffer before the transformation, and any rats that are killed cost the same percentage of the current LP.<br>
    This applies to conditions, states, and other energies, as well. The Blessed One cannot cast liturgical chants or spells while in rat form and cannot talk. Rats are considered sanctified to the Nameless One.

  effect: |
    Your character’s skin falls off their body, revealing a new face. You cannot choose your character’s new appearance — it receives a completely random face. However, your age, gender, body type, size, and eye and hair color remain the same. It is not possible to change species or subspecies (for example, from human to Thorwaler, Forest Folk, or Tulamydian). All physical advantages and disadvantages like *Good Looks*, *Stigma*, and *Ugly* remain. Shedding takes 7-QL hours.

    The Blessed one can create a zone with a static 5-yard radius. This zone prevents enemies from casting liturgical chants and ceremonies or ends their effects. If the QL of the Liturgical Absorption equal to or higher than the opposing chant or ceremony’s QL, the effect is prevented. If the QL is lower, it still weakens the opposing chant or ceremony (the difference between the two is its new effective QL).<br>
    When the zone prevents or dispels enemy chants and ceremonies, their KP reduce the zone’s strength. The strength of the zone is invested KP + (QL x 3). If its strength ever drops below 1, the zone collapses. Excess KP of the opposing liturgy are ignored, and the effect is still prevented completely

  effect: |
    Cause a target’s memories of a traumatic event (such as war, pestilence, or an encounter with a terrifying creature) to fade, relieving the target of any lingering harmful effects of such memories. The target may still willingly remember the event. Checks on *Treat Soul* against the target of the ceremony receive a bonus of QL/2 if it is related to processing the experiences.

  effect: |
    Suppress all personal memories the target has about a past event. The memories may encompass no more than QL days.
