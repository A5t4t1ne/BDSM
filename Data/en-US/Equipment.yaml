    - advantage: |
        Two or more fighters armed with war scythes may form a scythe wall. Participants must face the same direction and stay within 1.6 feet of their neighbor. Scythe walls theoretically have no upper limit on number of participants. Participants gain a PA bonus of +1. When performing the maneuver *Charge* en mass, they lose the PA bonus but gain +1 DP with the war scythe (see *Core Rules** Page **246**)
      disadvantage: |
        Whenever the war scythe causes 10+ DP in one blow, roll 1D6: on a 1, the blade falls off, leaving only a wooden staff (same stats as a club). Re-attaching the blade requires a check on *Metalworking (Blacksmith)* with a bonus of 3 (5 minutes, any number of attempts).

      If a check on *Survival (Build Campsite)* succeeds with QL 5+ when setting up the tent, it counts as a good accommodation and grants a bonus of +1 *LP/AE/KP* (see **Core Rules** Page **339**) during regeneration phases.<br>
      The tent offers protection from the cold, reducing *Cold levels* by 1. This benefit stacks with those granted by a woolen blanket and a sleeping bag.<br>
      Assembly and disassembly take 20 minutes each.

  versions:
    advantage: |
      Soap in a cloth tube botches only on a result of 20, not 19-20 (see **Core Rules** Page **235**)
    disadvantage: |
      When parried with a sharp weapon such as a sword or a dagger, roll 1D6. On a result of 4-6, this improvised weapon breaks and no longer functions as a weapon.

  name: "Grapnel with Climbing Rope"
  versions:
    rules: |
      A grapnel combined with a climbing rope can be thrown and hooked onto an appropriate surface, such as a sturdy branch or rock outcropping. This requires a check on RC for Thrown Weapons. The throw takes 2 actions, and the check receives a -1 penalty for every 16 feet of distance to the target.<br>
      A grapnel with at least 3 feet of rope can serve as an improvised weapon (see **Aventuria Armory ** Page **139**).
    advantage: |
      This weapon can be used for the maneuver *Takedown*, even though this would normally not be possible with chain weapons (see **Core Rules** Page **250**).
    disadvantage: |
      Because this is both a chain weapon and an improvised weapon, botches occur on 18-20 instead of 19-20. Also, on a confirmed botch, the wielder receives one level of *Stupor*.

    advantage: |
      When the hook dagger contributes to a successful parry, roll 1D6. On 1-2, apply a -1 penalty to the opponent's AT for the next CR. This rule does not apply when fighting an unarmed opponent.
    disadvantage: |
      Make a botch confirmation roll on an AT roll of 19+ instead of 20 (a botch is more likely).

  versions:
    advantage: |
      A person wounded by a poisoned Mengbilar subtracts 1 from *TOU* when making a poison check. This applies only if the weapon contains a weapon or contact poison (see **Core Rules** Page **342**). Any hit that causes DP triggers the poison check.
    disadvantage: |
      When attacking, the Mengbilar breaks on a confirmed botch.

  name: "Ogre Catcher"
  versions:
    advantage: |
      The hooks automatically extend when the weapon inflicts damage. Holding onto the weapon after the hooks extend requires a successful competitive check on *Feat of Strength (Dragging & Pulling)*. On the following CR, the wielder may attempt to pull the dagger from the enemy's flesh by making a brawling AT with a -2 penalty. If that check succeeds, a further successful *Feat of Strength (Dragging & Pulling)* check retrieves the weapon and inflicts an additional 1D6+2+QL DP. If any of those checks fail, the weapon remains stuck. On the next CR, increase the difficulty of the brawling AT by 4. Others within attack distance of the target may attempt to pull the dagger loose. While embedded, an ogre catcher inflicts 1 DP every 5 minutes. To remove it, either pull it out with brute strength (1D6+2 DP) or attempt to extract it carefully by making a Treat Wounds check. Failure inflicts 1D3 DP but takes only 1 minute.
    disadvantage: |
      When used for a successful parry, make a *Feat of Strength (Dragging & Pulling)* check. On a failure, the wielder drops the weapon.

      Parrying an ox-herd has a penalty of 3 instead of only 2 (see **Core Rules** Page **235**). When performing the maneuver *Hammer Blow*, roll 2D6 instead of 1D6, and add the higher die to the DP.
    disadvantage: |
      After rolling a botch - whether confirmed or unconfirmed - while making an attack, suffer 1 level of *Stupor*. On a confirmed botch, suffer 4 DP. These effects are in addition to any other botch results.

    advantage: |
      The wielder counts as armed and thus does not receive the usual penalties for brawling with an armed opponent (see **Core Rules** Page **235**).
    disadvantage: |
      The wielder cannot perform the maneuver *Grapple* and any other maneuvers based on grappling. Spiked vambraces are difficult to hide and incur a -2 penalty to *Stealth (Conceal Item)* checks.

Bucklers receive an additional -1 penalty to PA vs ranged attacks, in addition to all other applicable modifiers (see **Core Rules** Page **243**).
    advantage: |
      On an AT critical success, the target receives 1 additional level of *Stupor*.

    advantage: |
      A warrior with a glaive can form a wall with at least one another fighter who is armed in the same way. The fighting partner must be no further than 1.5 feet away, and both must face the same direction. If these conditions are met, a wall can consist of any number of fighters. All fighters in this wall receive a +1 bonus on PA. If the warriors cooperate to perform the maneuver *Charge*, they lose their PA bonus but inflict +1 DP (see **Core Rules** Page **246**).
    disadvantage: |
      When using the special ability *Pike Wall* (see **Aventuria Compendium** Page **154**), the wielder's AT has an increased difficulty of 1.

      If the wielder of an executioner's sword inflicts a critical hit or causes 16+ DP in one blow, all enemies within attack distance must make a *Willpower (Resist Intimidation)* check with a -1 penalty. If the check fails, that opponent suffers 1 level of *Fear* for 5 CR.<br>
      If using the focus rules for hit zones, a hit against the head inflicts DPx2.
    disadvantage: |
      After making an attack, the wielder cannot parry until the end of the next CR. However, the wielder may dodge, instead.

  versions:
    note: |
      Instead of causing DP, the target gains the state *Bound* until freed. To escape, make a cumulative *Body Control (Squirm)* check, or use a sharp weapon to cut the net or control rope (reduce its 10 structure points to 0). *Making a Body Control* check takes one regular action. When cutting the net, weapons with a reach of medium or greater inflict only half DP.
    advantage: |
      The target may make only one attempt to dodge a cast-net. Shields cannot parry cast-nets.
    disadvantage: |
      On a confirmed botch when attacking, the net thrower becomes entangled in the net and suffers all relevant effects.

        You can attack or parry with the pommel or the cross-guard, instead of the blade. To do so you must announce your intention in advance, and changing your grip takes 1 free action. Such attacks inflict 1D6+3 DP and receive an AT/PA Mod of 0/-2. The other stats do not change.
      disadvantage: |
        In cramped environments the Nostrianer receives AT/PA penalties of -5/-5 instead of -4/-4 (see **Core Rules** Page **238**). These additional penalties apply only when making regular attacks with the blade, not when using the weapon advantage.

    - note: |
        Use of the Nostrian longbow requires STR 14+
      advantage: |
        Even after a successful Shield Parry, the Nostrian longbow pierces the defender's shield and causes damage on a roll of 1-3 on 1D6. In this case, though, the defender adds the simple shield bonus to PRO.
      disadvantage: |
        Archers using a Nostrian longbow suffer a penalty of 4 in addition to any other modifiers (see **Core Rules** Page **348**) while in forests, which are classified as difficult or bad terrain. The Nostrian longbow cannot be used while mounted.
